## My first ever project
One of the many problems that i face when making this was Card Duplication after submitting.
looking back it was just a double funtion call.
i accidently called the onclick funtion in html, then proceed to addEventListener to the submit button again in JavaScript,
which cause the duplication, because it has been submitted twice.

but i have fixed it.

this was inspired by the Unsent Project, which is a well-known platform for secret messages, or confessions. 
and i think it is really meaningful, that is why i created this.
